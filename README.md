I'm Magdalena, and Iâ€™m a beginner full-stack developer based in Chile.

As I embark on my web development career, I am actively studying to enhance my skills. 


I am passionate about creating engaging, user-friendly web applications that provide seamless experiences. 

In addition to my technical abilities, I thrive in collaborative team environments where I can contribute my skills and learn from others. I am always eager to take on new challenges and explore cutting-edge tools and technologies in the web development realm.

I am highly motivated to take on new challenges and seek a company that will allow me to continue growing as a full-stack developer.
